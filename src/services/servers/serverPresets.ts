/**
 * Server style presets — curated, ready-made server configurations.
 *
 * "official" = canonical configurations of the server software itself
 * (vanilla survival, creative workshop, performance-tuned Paper).
 * "community" = beloved community game styles (SkyBlock, Prison, PvP…)
 * expressed through OUR curated properties + the app's own datapack
 * modules — nothing from third-party plugins/packs is redistributed.
 *
 * Properties are validated by the Rust merge (servers.rs) — format-only
 * keys, `online-mode` is never overridable.
